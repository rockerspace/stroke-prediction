3. Correlation analysis:
a. Explore and visualize the correlation between different features and
identify key relationships that could possibly impact the target column

4. Missing Values:
a. Identify and handle any missing values in the dataset and justify your
approach for implementation

 create a machine learning model to train, test and validate the
model.

implement a hyper parameter tuning procedure for the model
and showcase a systematic approach for improving model accuracy.

Create a web service in python which we can test through postman, which will
accept values as json (sample values attached) and provide the response from the
prediction module.
